preparationAndUsage
 Takes from 5 - 10 minutes<br />Beautifully smooth skin in just 5 Steps<br />Before using, please read pack precautions carefully.<br />1 Before you shower, use the soft, coloured side of the sponge to apply the cream evenly onto dry skin. Don't rub it in. Make sure the hair you want to remove is completely covered. Don't forget to wash any cream off your hands.<br />2 Wait at least 2 minutes before stepping into the shower.<br />3 Now continue with your normal shower routine. For the first 3 minutes, try to avoid putting the cream directly in the stream of water, so that it stays on long enough to work. It is usual for some cream to gradually wash away at this stage.<br />4 Now that the cream has been on your skin for 5 minutes in total, use the white side of the sponge to gently remove a small test area of cream. If the hair comes away easily, massage the sponge in a circular motion to remove the rest. If your hair is more stubborn, you can leave the cream on for up to 5 more minutes - but not any longer, as you don't want to exceed a total of 10 minutes with the cream on your skin. For more sensitive areas use the soft, coloured side of the sponge to remove the cream.<br />5 Rinse your skin thoroughly with water to remove the cream completely, and then dry. Rinse the sponge, and keep the tube closed when not in use to make sure the cream stays effective.","Veet In Shower Hair Removal Cream Body & Legs for Sensitive Skin Veet Hair Removal Cream, now with Silky Fresh™ Technology.Experience silky smooth skin and delightful scent while removing hair effectively.

 Takes from 5 - 10 minutes<br />Beautifully smooth skin in just 5 Steps<br />Before using, please read pack precautions carefully.<br />1 Before you shower, use the soft, coloured side of the sponge to apply the cream evenly onto dry skin. Don't rub it in. Make sure the hair you want to remove is completely covered. Don't forget to wash any cream off your hands.<br />2 Wait at least 2 minutes before stepping into the shower.<br />3 Now continue with your normal shower routine. For the first 3 minutes, try to avoid putting the cream directly in the stream of water, so that it stays on long enough to work. It is usual for some cream to gradually wash away at this stage.<br />4 Now that the cream has been on your skin for 5 minutes in total, use the white side of the sponge to gently remove a small test area of cream. If the hair comes away easily, massage the sponge in a circular motion to remove the rest. If your hair is more stubborn, you can leave the cream on for up to 5 more minutes - but not any longer, as you don't want to exceed a total of 10 minutes with the cream on your skin. For more sensitive areas use the soft, coloured side of the sponge to remove the cream.<br />5 Rinse your skin thoroughly with water to remove the cream completely, and then dry. Rinse the sponge, and keep the tube closed when not in use to make sure the cream stays effective.",shower hair removal cream body leg sensitive skin hair removal cream silky fresh silky smooth skin delightful scent removing hair effectively hydrate skin hour also clinically proven provide day smoothness summer short spend experience silky smooth delightfully scented skin shower hair removal cream normal skin cream dissolve rather cut hair unwanted hair take longer grow back shaving stubbly feel regrowth work close root even short hair whilst removing hair hydrate skin hour fragrance technology also designed ensure suitable use shower help reduce length routine brand feature clinically proven day smoothness skin sensitive skin body leg soothing aloe vera violet blossom fragrance tested suitable woman men blister pack find contact u visit leg body work whilst shower effective even short hair hair removal cream sensitive skin aloe vera vitamin e sumptuous softness leaf skin impeccably smooth day suitable short hair leg arm bikini line work shower silky skin minute safety precaution retain outer full precaution direction read follow precaution direction use exceed minute total application suitable use leg arm bikini line suitable use head face eye nose ear around anus genitals nipple body use varicose vein scar mole spotty broken sunburnt skin skin ha adverse reaction hair removal cream past always leave hour hair removal check doctor medication affect skin suffer skin related disorder condition may affect every use test skin reaction removing product small part area wish treat following direction use hour adverse reaction continue experience use remove product immediately rinse thoroughly cold water burning sensation seek medical skin may sensitive short time use avoid use recommend waiting hour perfumed product artificial tanning equipment swimming keep reach case ingestion seek medical advice immediately show outer avoid contact eye case contact eye rinse immediately plenty water seek medical alkali product may cause surface become avoid spillage carpet clothes additional trade mark group adult need around day applicable nonfood product pet food note product subject change include ingredient allergen nutrition storage information safety warning cooking instruction alcohol content therefore important check label allergy advice product delivery page serf summary information purpose designed enhance shopping experience taken care summary believe accurate substitute reading product label prior use description link another party information product please note supermarket limited ha control liability content party also note picture image show serving suggestion prepare food table accessory additional item ingredient pictured product included data personal use may way whatsoever without supermarket limited prior consent without due take beautifully smooth skin please read pack precaution shower use soft side sponge apply cream evenly onto dry skin dont rub make sure hair want remove completely covered dont forget wash cream wait least minute stepping continue normal shower routine first minute try avoid cream directly stream water stay long enough work usual cream gradually wash away cream ha skin minute total use white side sponge gently remove small test area cream hair come away easily massage sponge circular motion remove rest hair stubborn leave cream minute longer dont want exceed total minute cream skin sensitive area use soft side sponge remove rinse skin thoroughly water remove cream completely dry rinse sponge keep tube closed use make sure cream stay effective,Toiletries & Beauty | Shaving & Hair Removal | Womens Razors & Blades | Veet In Shower Hair Removal Cream Body & Legs for Sensitive Skin,Razors,Sam,,,
