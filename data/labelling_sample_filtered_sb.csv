How to find your perfect brown shade for you:

Have you ever wondered what the hair colour numbers mean? The first number of a Hair Colour is how Light or Dark the Brown hair dye will be, for example brown shades range from 4, Dark Brown to 6, Light Brown. The second number is the reflect which can be Natural (.0), Warm (.3, .4, .5, .6) or Cool (.1, .2). For example, 5.0 is a Natural Medium Brown, 4.3 is a Golden Dark Brown, and 5.12 is a Glacial Brown. Always check the back of pack to see if it is the right shade for you. Try Davina McCall's Shade 5.0 Mocha Brown.
Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color bold, intense at home hair dye gives you nourished, vibrant, long-lasting hair colour. The exclusive colour boost technology boots your colour by infusing intense dyes at the heart of the fibre, for up to 8 weeks of intense bold colour. Choosing your perfect Nutrisse shade: Your hair dye colour result will vary depending on your natural hair colour - check the back of pack. Remember to always do your patch test 48 hours before colouring your hair at home. Top tips: Use an old towel as hair colour may stain it. Apply moisturising cream to your hairline to avoid staining. Hair Dye can only lighten your natural hair colour 1 to 2 levels. If you have long or thick hair, use two hair dye boxes.

When you brush with our great-tasting formulation, active minerals microscopically absorb into your teeth, fortifying and strengthening them from the inside out. This creates a protective 24hr Enamel Shield* to help lock out sugar acid attack. Aquafresh Fresh and Minty is a fluoride-based toothpaste that protects your teeth and leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. It is for anyone who wants to maintain a good oral hygiene and actively protect and strengthen their teeth, maintain healthy gums and have a minty fresh breath.

One of the main causes of bad breath is bacterial plaque, caused by poor oral hygiene. With twice daily brushing, Aquafresh Fresh and Minty plays an active role in removing plaque and food debris to help fight bad breath. Brush twice a day and not more than three times, minimise swallowing and spit out.

Keep out of reach of children. In children aged 6 or younger use a pea-sized amount under supervised brushing to minimise swallowing. If irritation occurs, discontinue use. Talk to your dentist or doctor as soon as possible, if you experience swelling of the mouth or face.

preparationAndUsage
 Tip 1: Warm water softens thick and stubborn hairs and allows for more of the hair to be exposed from beneath the skin. Wash your face thoroughly for about two to three minutes before shaving for an optimal result. <br />Tip 2: For a particularly close shave, use shaving gel or soap. This also ensures that the blades of your razor glide easily over the skin, protecting against shaving irritation. Shave without pressure. <br />Tip 3: After shaving, cool water not only removes hair debris and residual shaving gel, but also closes the pores of your skin, for a smooth finish.<br />Tip 4: Replace the blades of your Wilkinson Sword razor regularly (depending on your shaving routine). If you find your blade no longer glides easily over the skin, it's time to change. Dull blades cannot shave as thoroughly and are more likely to cause skin irritation as you push harder against your skin.","Wilkinson Sword Hydro 5 Men's Razor  Experience a masterfully close shave with the Hydro 5 razor from Wilkinson Sword.
